                    A: Not a problem! Give as much, or as little location information as you'd like. We just ask that you give us at least a city/region and country, since the purpose of this site is to see stories located around the world.

                <Typography component="p">
                    A: Lavender/purple pins are personal stories. Green pins are community histories, or stories that have significance to LGBTQ communities on a scale larger than the individual. For example, Stonewall would be considered a community story, as would, say, the legalization of gay marriage in California, or the first lesbian couple to get married (quite publically) in Taiwan. Red pins are current locations of active organizations and resources for LGBTQ individuals.
